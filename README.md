# Career Module

This module is a super simple career module. It allows you to create multiple sites and positions and you can apply to
them.
The admin panel is created with filament (i wanted to try it out), also the frontend is AI generated (Switched to
Codeium from Copilot to test it out).

## What can it do?

* You can create multiple sites and positions, you can specify extra questions by position
* Guest users are able to apply to a position
* From the admin panel you are able to see all applications and give them a judgement. If you choose Round 2 the site
  will send a link via e-mail where the user can reserve a time for the interview. This action will generate a Google
  Calendar event

## Frontend

* AI generated
